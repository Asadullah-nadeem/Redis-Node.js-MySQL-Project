# Redis + Node.js + MySQL Project

## About This Project

Sometimes we get very curious and excited to build something new. This project is one of those ideas â€” a simple but exciting web app using  **Node.js** ,  **Redis** , and  **MySQL** .

The idea is to understand and demonstrate how Redis works, especially in real-world situations like:

* Handling **multiple users** (e.g., what if 10,000 users visit the site?)
* **Load balancing** concepts (not implemented yet, but will be added in the future)
* How Redis can help **speed up data processing** and reduce the load on MySQL
